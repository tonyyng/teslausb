OPTIONAL: You can choose to integrate with [Pushover](https://pushover.net), [Gotify](https://gotify.net/), [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), [Telegram](https://telegram.org) and/or [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) to get a push/email notification to your phone when the copy process is done. Depending on your wireless network speed/connection, copying files may take some time, so a push notification can help confirm that the process finished. If no files were copied (i.e. all manually saved dashcam files were already copied, no notification will be sent.).

# Pushover
The Pushover service is free for up to 7,500 messages per month, but the [iOS](https://pushover.net/clients/ios)/[Android](https://pushover.net/clients/android) apps do have a one time cost, after a free trial period. *This also assumes your Pi is connected to a network with internet access.*

1. On the Pushover dashboard on the web, copy your **User key**.
1. [Create a new Application](https://pushover.net/apps/build) at Pushover.net. The description and icon don't matter, choose what you prefer.
1. Copy the **Application Key** for the application you just created. The User key + Application Key are basically a username/password combination to needed to send the push.
1. Run these commands, substituting your user key and app key in the appropriate places. No `"` are needed.
    ```
    export PUSHOVER_ENABLED=true
    export PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=put_your_userkey_here
    export PUSHOVER_APP_KEY=put_your_appkey_here
    ```

# Gotify
Gotify is a self-hosted notification service. The android client is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.gotify), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/com.github.gotify/), or a standalone [APK](https://github.com/gotify/android/releases/latest).

    ```
    export GOTIFY_ENABLED=true
    export GOTIFY_DOMAIN=https://gotify.domain.com
    export GOTIFY_APP_TOKEN=put_your_token_here
    export GOTIFY_PRIORITY=5
    ```

# IFTTT
